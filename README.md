The task involved monitoring the attrition rate by considering various influencing factors.
I created a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI using different tools like Power Query and DAX functions, along with utilizing charts, filters, and slicers.
This dashboard was designed to analyze and visualize attrition trends effectively.

By leveraging this dashboard, I identified critical factors contributing to attrition and proposed actionable insights to mitigate it. 
These insights were aimed at improving the hiring process, enhancing the overall employee experience, increasing workforce productivity, and nurturing employee trust.
All these recommendations were derived from a thorough analysis of data, ensuring a data-driven approach to address attrition-related challenges.
